<h2>In Short</h2>

<p>I am a builder of meaningful solutions. I left my job assessing noise/chemical exposures in November of 2012 and taught myself Android. I realized I need and want to work on a team, so I signed up for <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/learn-more/">Dev Bootcamp</a>. I am now equipped to contribute as a full-stack web or Android developer.</p>

<h3>Build Things</h3>

<p>As a kid, I once built a very tall car from K'nex. Being tall is cool, but the height also served a purpose: potential energy. I couldn't have defined the term at the time, but I knew I could put a heavy object up high, turn the string it was hanging on around with a pulley, and wrap it around an axle.  The vehicle moved on it's own. Giving behavior to inanimate objects is <em>Fun</em>.</p>

<h3>Things that Matter</h3>

<p>For over 5 years I supported people with developmental disabilities and mental illnesses. Service to others is not an alltruistic goal or ideal -- it's simply something I enjoy. I eventually felt there was more I could do, so I set out to become a doctor.</p>

<h3>Things that are Challenging</h3>

<p>I taught myself calculus after not using algebra or trigonometry for over 3 years. I took chemistry, physics, and biology for majors in one semester. I earned a score on the MCAT which is better than most doctors. It still didn't work out, and I moved on.</p>

<h3>Builds that Matter</h3>

<p>After college, I worked assessing noise and chemical exposures supported by software which could use UX redesign. I built a simple script to automate some data entry, and my coworkers were impressed and relieved. It had it's own behavior, it mattered, but it wasn't all that challenging.</p>

<h3>Challenging Builds that Matter</h3>

<p>I built an Android app which enables on-the-go planning of air sampling. It works, it matters, and it was challenging, but getting the solution into users' hands involves much more than just building it.</p>

<h3>Build With Friends</h3>

<p>I want to see a product I helped build in users' hands. That goal is best achieved as part of a team. At Dev Bootcamp I've gotten excellent suppport in developing further technical skills, but more importantly I've practiced and refined my ability to communicate. I loved the collaborative culture and practices at DBC.</p>

<h2>The Rest of the Story</h2>

<p>I'm looking for opportunities for further collaboration and continuous learning. I'd love to talk more! The world is filled with interesting projects. <a href="mailto:tylerhartland7@gmail.com" target="_top">What's yours?</a></p>
